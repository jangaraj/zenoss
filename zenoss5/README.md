Zenoss Core 5 autodeploy script (beta)
======================================
Auto-deployment script for Zenoss Core 5 on CentOS 7.x or Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux 7.x. Ubuntu is not supported at the moment. A 64-bit build is required.

The script included in this directory will automatically deploy Zenoss Core 5 
and Control Center for you. 

```
# cd /tmp
# chmod +x core-autodeploy.sh
# ./core-autodeploy.sh
```

The script will take several minutes (around 15-30) to complete. When done, 
you should have a prepared Zenoss Core 5 fresh installation and should be able 
to visit Control Center in a Web browser to start Zenoss Core 5 application.

Script requires mounted directories:

```
/var/lib/docker 
/opt/serviced/var
/opt/serviced/var/volumes
/opt/serviced/var/backups
```

Or you can pass a block device for formatting and mounting of required filesystem. 
Confirmation is needed before formatting. E.g.:

```
# ./core-autodeploy.sh -d </var/lib/docker block device> -s </opt/serviced/var block device>
 -v </opt/serviced/var/volumes block device> -b </opt/serviced/var/backups block device>

# ./core-autodeploy.sh -d /dev/sdb1 -s /dev/sdb3 -v /dev/sdc1 -b /dev/sdd1
```

Example
=======

```
[root@localhost ~]# ./core-autodeploy.sh
